# 7-lives

 The summer collapses in the winter, the leaves of the trees go from the ground to its stem, the rain falls towards the heavens and the sun rises in the west. 

 Days of reversal, indecisive and fragile time converging at its beginning and ending point, but, who observes this convergence? Who is the witness of the everything and nothing? 

 In his attempt to change the course of time, a man will give everything to restore the distorted reality that has been created over his life by taking it to the most unthinkable human limit.
